# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** The agent removes redundant tasks from the operator's day by watching, learning, and autonomously executing -- getting better at each task every time it does it.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Secure Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Secure Infrastructure) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (all complete)
Status: Phase complete -- ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-02-28 -- Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (n8n proxy workflows, HITL tier enforcement)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 14%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: mixed (cross-session + 7min + 70min)
- Total execution time: ~3 sessions

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-secure-infrastructure | 3/3 | cross-session + 77min | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (cross-session), 01-03 (7min), 01-02 (70min)
- Trend: Phase 1 complete

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P03 | 7min | 2 tasks | 13 files |
| Phase 01 P02 | 70min | 2 tasks | 11 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Infrastructure and Security combined into Phase 1 -- both are hard prerequisites for all external integrations
- [Roadmap]: Memory and Model Routing combined into Phase 2 -- both are foundational services consumed by all skills
- [Roadmap]: iMessage (COMM-05, COMM-06) placed in Phase 4 with Task Management -- iMessage is a context source for todos and check-ins, not a communication channel to build separately
- [Roadmap]: OCR Screen Watching deferred to Phase 7 -- high privacy surface, requires mature check-in system to enrich
- [01-01]: n8n pinned to v2.5.2 for CVE-2026-25049 -- no "latest" tag for security-critical services
- [01-01]: All Docker ports bound to 127.0.0.1 only -- Tailscale is the sole remote access path
- [01-01]: Tailscale ACLs deferred -- personal tailnet, defense-in-depth only (single user, no multi-user risk)
- [01-01]: Tailscale serve root path to n8n (port 5678) -- dashboard not yet running, will reconfigure when needed
- [01-01]: Qdrant and n8n given tmpfs mounts for read-only FS compatibility
- [01-03]: better-sqlite3 for synchronous cost tracking -- avoids async overhead in pre-call limit checks
- [01-03]: Keyword-based directive verification (2-of-3 threshold) -- tolerates summarization whitespace changes
- [01-03]: Reconciliation degrades gracefully without ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_API_KEY -- local-only tracking still enforces limits
- [01-03]: Structured JSON logging for all safety/cost events -- ready for future observability pipeline
- [01-02]: Inline sanitizer per proxy instead of Execute Sub-Workflow -- n8n sub-workflow trigger had JSON parsing issues
- [01-02]: All 6 proxies start as stubs -- ready for API key configuration without code changes
- [01-02]: DELETE=RED hardcoded before config lookup -- cannot be overridden by YAML (SECR-07)
- [01-02]: Unknown actions default to RED (fail-secure) -- only explicitly GREEN actions auto-approve
- [01-02]: YELLOW tier treated as RED until Phase 3 Telegram approval channel

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5]: Gamma MCP access is gated -- must confirm API access before planning Phase 5. Fallback: manual Gamma + Telegram outline notification.
- [Phase 4]: BlueBubbles June 2026 Apple API deprecation -- Phase 4 iMessage work must complete before June or have contingency.
- [Phase 7]: Supabase project is paused (jitawzicdwgbhatvjblh) -- must reactivate and confirm Pro tier before Phase 7.
- [Phase 4]: Fellow API requires workspace admin toggle -- confirm access level before planning Phase 4.

## Session Continuity
